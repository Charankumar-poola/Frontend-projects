    <p style="color: orange;">At the back of the book there are Additional exercises (pages 302â€“325).These exercises bring together 
        some of the grammar points from a number of different units.For example, Exercise 16 brings together 
        grammar points from Units 26.

    <pre style="color: rgb(2, 2, 94);"> The book will probably be most useful at middle and upper-intermediate levels and can serve both as a basis for revision and as a means 
        for practising new structures.It will also be useful for some more advanced students who have 
        problems with grammar and need a book for reference and practice.  The book is not intended to be 
        used by elementary learners.</pre>

    <div style="color: rgba(7, 189, 7, 0.747);">The book can be used for immediate consolidation or for later revision or remedial work.  It might 
        be used by the whole class or by individual students needing extra help.The left-hand pages 
        (explanations and examples) are written for the student to use individually, but they may of course 
        be used by the teacher as a source of ideas and information on which to base a lesson.</div></p>
